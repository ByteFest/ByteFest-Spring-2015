##ByteFest Team Presentations##

This year’s ByteFest competition places a large emphasis on team presentations that will wrap-up the week long algorithm challenge.  A key aim of ByteFest is to challenge not just your technical chops, but your communication, collaboration, and organizational skills.

Teams who compete in this phase of competition will be asked to give a brief (5 minute) presentation to a panel of judges.  **The content & format of the presentation is totally up to you.**  Teams are _encouraged_ to consider the provided list of open questions and judging rubrics.   

###Presentation Ideas:
This list is meant only to serve as inspiration. 
_Teams are by no-means expected to answer all of them_, but they might serve as a starting point for your thoughtful and engaging presentation.

*	Who are you?  (just a brief intro please)
*	What was the problem?  What are the important parts?
*	How did you start?
*	Did you solve the problem?  How does your solution work? 
  *	Did you use any special data types or structures? Which ones and why?
  *	Did you use any libraries?  Which ones and why?
*	How did you work as a team?
*	Did your entire team have the same understanding?  How did you resolve confusion?
*	Did you have multiple solutions? How did you select one?
*	How long did it take you to solve?
*	How did you test your solution?
*	Is your solution efficient?  Do you think a better solution exists?
*	Is there anything especially interesting about your solution?
*	Did you try anything that failed? What happened? How did you fix it?
*	Did you have to debug anything? How?
*	Did you create any design artifacts?  Diagrams, napkin drawings, etc…
*	Is there anything else you want the judges to know about what you did this week?
