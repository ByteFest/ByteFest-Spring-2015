#Competition Day Information
###Rules for Competition Day###
1. Each team will use a **single** workstation. 
1. Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called runs. Each run is judged as accepted or rejected by a judge, and the team is notified of the results.
1. Notification of accepted runs may be suspended at an appropriate time to keep the final results secret. A general announcement to that effect will be made during the contest. Notification of rejected runs will continue until the end of the contest.
1. A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem statement by submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a clarification will be issued to **all** contestants.
1. Contestants are not to converse with anyone except members of their team and personnel designated by the  contest director. Systems support staff may advise contestants on system-related problems such as explaining system error messages.


**In order for solutions to be accepted they must meet these requirements: **

1.  Follow all requirements in the problem statement, including output to standard out, and input from the specified file name when applicable
1.	All problem submissions must include an executable ( main() method) that runs.   
1.	All submissions must compile and execute. 
1.	Any modification to code after submission to a judge is considered a separate submission.
1.	All submission executables must be non-interactive.  

####Scoring
A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In consultation with the judges, the  Contest Director determines the winners of the contest. 

Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved.  Teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.
