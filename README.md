# ByteFest-Spring-2015
##Spring 2015 Contest Information##

  We’re pleased to announce the ByteFest Spring Algorithm challenge coming on April 11th, 2015. 
  
  This year’s contest will be conducted in two phases.  

- ***Phase 1:*** Beginning on April 6th at 3:00pm, teams will be invited to an open coding challenge.  We will kick this off with an online meeting through Microsoft Lync.  During that launch, we will explain the open coding challenge, which basically consists of a problem created for students to work on solving throughout the week.  The idea is teams work as they are able and by the end of the week will have submitted a solution.  This phase wraps up with a presentation from each team the morning on April 11th.  

- ***Phase 2:*** A timed coding challenge, where students will have 2 hours to solve a number of problems of varying difficulties.  

Students can compete in C++, Java, or Python.
